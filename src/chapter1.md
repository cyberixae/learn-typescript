# Preface

Computers are machines that can do almost anything as long as we manage to describe what we want them to do.

Computers contain memory that consists of some number of bits. There is no way to delete a bit.
Bits can only be changed from zero to one or one to zero. The main memory in a computer
consists of mutable RAM memory that can be modified by a processor and gets cleared when there
is no power. In addition to RAM memory, computers may contain immutable ROM memory that was
set to contain certain bits when the computer was created and the value of those bits will never
change. Finally, a computer may contain storage, which is mutable like RAM but will retain it's
value when there is no power.

A computer also contains one or more processors that can be used to manipulate some part of the memory.
The amount of things that a single computer can do at one time is limited by the amount of processors.
To execute a program a processor is initialized with the starting location of the program code within
the memory of the computer. The processor will then proceed by interpreting that part of the memory
as instructions and will modify other parts of the memory based on those instructions. The bits
themselves do *not* have any intrinsic meaning. By poiting the processor at a certain memory location
we *decide* to interpret that part of the memory as executable program code.

Humans interact with computers through human interface devices. Some early computers, like the Altair 8800
home computer, used lights and switches for this purpose. The lights would show whether a bit was one or zero
and the switches would let you set bits to one or zero. These days it is more common to use more complicated
input and output devices like keyboards containing some human readable characters and monitors that display
some part of the memory as a constantly updating picture. The more advanced human interface devices work as
abstractions making it unnecessary to understand the exact bit representations.


This kind of abastraction is central to the
development of compu


With direct bit manipulation made impossible, writing computer programs in a programming language is now the
most direct form of human-computer interaction.
Various programming languages have been developed for this purpose.
